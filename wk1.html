                <br> Planning
            </h4>
            <p>I figured out what type of sweater I wanted to make.<br>
                <br>I picked out colors of yarn and the wave pattern, then I looked up how to do the ripple stitch.<br>
               <br>This website was put together so I can document my progress.<br>
               <br>I ordred yarn and picked a 6mm hook to crochet with.<br>
               <br>I started using an app (asana) to keep my goals organized and to help me stay on track.<br>
               <br>I tried to figure out an easy way to publish this site once it is finished, but I didn't find anything yet.<br>
              <br>I completely changed the color scheme and fonts on this website.<br>
              </p>
            <h4>
              Future Plans
            </h4>
            <p>
              I want to make a swatch of the ripple stitch for measurments.<br>
              <br>Keep this website updated with daily progress.<br>
              <br>Minimize distractons get "good" work done each day.<br>
              <br>Figure out a way to use my phone less that is productive and does not feel like a punishment.<br>
              <br>Pick a day to spell check everything that has been added.<br>
