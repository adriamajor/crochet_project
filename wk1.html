               <br>-This website was put together so I can document my progress
               <br>-Ordred yarn and picked a 6mm hook to crochet wiht
               <br>-I started using an app (asana) to keep my goals organized and to help me stay on track
               <br>-Tried to figure out an easy way to publish this site once it is finished, but I didn't find anything yet
            </p>
